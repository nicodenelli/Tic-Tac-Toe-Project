# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares.
## Technologies used
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, Visual Studio Code, and used my mac laptop to access and use these technologies.
## Getting Started
1) Click the following link to get to the game board -> https://nicodenelli.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-Project/

2) Once the gameboard is loaded, players must decide who will go first, player-1 will always be "O" and player-2 will always be "X"

3) At any point during the game if a row, column, or diagonal exist of three consecutive O's or X's the game will end and the title will change displaying the winner of the game. 

4) If the gameboard is filled with characters and neither player has won the title will remain unchanged and the option to reset the gameboard will be available in a button below the board labeled "PLay Again!"

## Next Steps

1) I have been trying to finalize the player vs cpu functionality but must be missing or overlooking something in my code. Currently the game does not keep a tally of the CPU's wins, only the players. Granted, the CPU difficulty is extremely low and this case should currently never occur, but if there were to be a difficulty setting later on, this would be an issue, as well as just the simple idea that everything is working as it should be.
