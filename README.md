3) At any point during the game if a row, column, or diagonal exist of three consecutive O's or X's the game will end and the title will change displaying the winner of the game. 

4) If the gameboard is filled with characters and neither player has won the title will remain unchanged and the option to reset the gameboard will be available in a button below the board labeled "PLay Again!"
